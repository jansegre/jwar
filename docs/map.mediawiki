== Territories ==
The following is a typical layout of the ''Risk'' game board, with a table of the corresponding continent and territory names.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamingcorner.nl/risk-territories.htm | title = Risk territories | work = The Gaming Corner | accessdate = 2006-05-12}}</ref> Each territory on the typical ''Risk'' game board represents a real-life geographical or political region on Earth. As such, the territory [[border]]s are drawn to resemble the geography of those regions. This provides an interior space on which to place the army units, adds an element of realism to the game, and also adds complexity.

The numbers in parentheses represent the number of additional armies granted during the reinforcement stage of a player's turn who controls all of the territories in that continent.
